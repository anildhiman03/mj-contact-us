== Changelog ==

The only issue I had was the plugin does not draw itself where it is called with the shortcode, instead it is drawing itself at the top of the page. I'm just getting back to it today, so I'm not clear if it is a CSS issue or something else.I'm getting notices on updates to this thread so I'll watch for you.I really like your idea here, editing the code directly for customization is a simple and direct method for a simple task like this, it makes it smaller, tighter and faster, all good things :)" * added multiple form capability * added mulitple form field added capability. * added save form capability
